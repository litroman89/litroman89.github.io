                <h2>Introducting OurSupport's Sales Advocate Program</h2>

                <p>

                    We're excited to introduce the OurSupport Sales Advocate Program – a great initiative to transform
                    our user community into a formidable force of advocates.
                    This program extends an invitation to both our dedicated internal sales professionals and external
                    users with permission, empowering them to get to know and
                    promote the ourSupport services.

                    <br><br>

                    The Sales Advocate Program aims to build authentic connections, strengthen customer relationships,
                    and foster a dynamic environment where
                    advocates play a central role in shaping the success of OurSupport. This advocate-driven approach
                    not only enhances our outreach
                    but also creates a rewarding experience for all involved.

                </p>

                <h3>Non-Employment Relationship</h3>

                <p>
                    This agreement does not establish an employer-employee relationship between the Sales Advocate and
                    Oursupport.
                    The Sales Advocate is not an employee or contractor of Oursupport, its shareholders, or direct
                    employees.
                </p>


                <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

                <p>
                    Oursupport disclaims any liability for errors, omissions, or any issues arising to or from the Sales
                    Advocate. Oursupport is not liable for any consequences or expectations that may be or have been
                    transmitted to new customers upon signing via the Sales Advocate Program.
                </p>


                <h3>Self-Responsibility</h3>

                <p>
                    The Sales Advocate is responsible for staying informed about relevant knowledge and training
                    materials. Oursupport is not obligated, however will time to time provide ongoing training or
                    support beyond what is initially specified.
                </p>

                <h3>Commission Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    A. The Sales Advocate is entitled to a 5% commission on the total spend (total excluding value-added
                    taxes) by their customers during the first 12 months from the day the customer signs up for
                    Oursupport.

                    <br><br>

                    B. After the initial 12-month period, the Sales Advocate will earn a 3% commission on the customer's
                    revenue (total excluding value-added taxes) provided the customer uses and pays for a minimum of 2
                    hours of work within a 3-month period. If there is inactivity for over 3 months in the second year,
                    the Sales Advocate's connection to this customer is terminated.
                </p>

                <h3>Commission Structure Evaluation</h3>
                <p>
                    Oursupport reserves the right to evaluate and change the commission structure with a 30-day notice
                    period.
                    However, any changes will not affect the initial time frames set out in the commission structure
                    specified in this policy to existing customers within their first year.
                </p>


                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>
                    Either party may terminate this agreement with notice. Termination does not affect commissions
                    earned prior to termination.
                </p>


                <h3>Governing Law</h3>

                        third
                        party
                        without prior, written approval from the disclosing Party and shall protect such Confidential
                        Information
                        from inadvertent disclosure to a third party using the same care and diligence that the
                        Recipient uses
                        to
                        protect its own proprietary and confidential information, but in no case less than reasonable
                        care. The
                        Recipient shall ensure that each of its employees, officers, directors, or agents who have
                        access to
                        Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement is informed of its proprietary and
                        confidential
                        nature and is required to abide by the terms of this Agreement. The Recipient of Confidential
                        Information
                        disclosed under this Agreement shall promptly notify the disclosing Party of any disclosure of
                        such
                        Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement or of any subpoena or other legal
                        process
                        requiring
                        production or disclosure of said Confidential Information.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall be and remain the property of
                        the
                        disclosing Party and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or
                        conferring
                        any
                        rights to such Confidential Information on the other Party. The Recipient shall honour any
                        request from
                        the
                        disclosing Party to promptly return or destroy all copies of Confidential Information disclosed
                        under
                        this
                        Agreement and all notes related to such Confidential Information. The Parties agree that the
                        disclosing
                        Party will suffer irreparable injury if its Confidential Information is made public, released to
                        a third
                        party, or otherwise disclosed in breach of this Agreement and that the disclosing Party shall be
                        entitled to
                        obtain injunctive relief against a threatened breach or continuation of any such breach and, in
                        the
                        event of
                        such breach, an award of actual and exemplary damages from any court of competent jurisdiction.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party’s right to develop
                        independently
                        or
                        acquire products without the use of the other Party’s Confidential Information. The disclosing
                        party
                        acknowledges that the Recipient may currently or in the future be developing information
                        internally, or
                        receiving information from other parties, that is like the Confidential Information. Nothing in
                        this
                        Agreement will prohibit the Recipient from developing or having developed for it products,
                        concepts,
                        systems
                        or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques
                        contemplated
                        by or embodied in the Confidential Information provided that the Recipient does not violate any
                        of its
                        obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Notwithstanding the above, the Parties agree that information shall not be deemed Confidential
                        Information and the Recipient shall have no obligation to hold in confidence such information,
                        where
                        such information:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Is already known to the Recipient, having been disclosed to the Recipient by a third
                                party
                                without such
                                third party having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; or
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Recipient, its employees,
                                officers, directors,
                                or agents; or
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to any Confidential
                                Information
                                disclosed
                                hereunder; or
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Is approved for release (and only to the extent so approved) by the disclosing Party; or
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Is disclosed pursuant to the lawful requirement of a court or governmental agency or
                                where
                                required by
                                operation of law.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to constitute an agency, partnership, joint
                        venture, or
                        other
                        similar relationship between the Parties.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Neither Party will, without prior approval of the other Party, make any public announcement of
                        or
                        otherwise
                        disclose the existence or the terms of this Agreement.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties and in no way creates an
                        obligation for
                        either Party to disclose information to the other Party or to enter into any other agreement.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        This Agreement shall remain in effect indefinitely from the Effective Date unless otherwise
                        terminated
                        by either Party giving notice to the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement. The
                        requirement to
                        protect Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall survive termination of
                        this
                        Agreement.
                    </li>
