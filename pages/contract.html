                When informed of the proprietary and confidential nature of Confidential Information that has been
                disclosed

                party

                Information
                from inadvertent disclosure to a third party using the same care and diligence that the Recipient uses
                to
                protect its own proprietary and confidential information, but in no case less than reasonable care. The
                Recipient shall ensure that each of its employees, officers, directors, or agents who have access to
                Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement is informed of its proprietary and confidential

                Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement or of any subpoena or other legal process

                rights to such Confidential Information on the other Party. The Recipient shall honour any request from
                the

                this
                Agreement and all notes related to such Confidential Information. The Parties agree that the disclosing
                Party will suffer irreparable injury if its Confidential Information is made public, released to a third
                party, or otherwise disclosed in breach of this Agreement and that the disclosing Party shall be
