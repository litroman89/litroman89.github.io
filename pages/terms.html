            These are the standard terms on which services ("Services") are supplied by OurSupport to the customer
            ("Customer") for the prices and/or license fees ("Charges") specified in these terms and conditions and
            associated Schedule. OurSupport is a platform that facilitates IT support onsite or remote for everyone. If
            any hardware ("Hardware"), third-party software ("Software"), or licenses are purchased, a separate
            agreement will be made according to European laws.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-acceptanceTitle">1. Order Acceptance</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-acceptanceDescription">
            1.1. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by OurSupport in writing, these terms and conditions will apply to
            any orders or requests from the Customer for Services and will supersede any other terms and conditions
            referred to, offered, or relied on by the Customer. Specific terms and conditions of OurSupport relating to
            Services will prevail over these conditions in the event of any conflict. Subject to this, no variation to
            these terms will be binding unless agreed to and signed by a director of OurSupport (Tsolnetworks Connect
            Europe, S.A known as OurSupport).
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-deliveryTitle">2. Delivery of Services and Risk of Loss</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-deliveryDescription">
            2.1. Each service delivery under this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a separate agreement to which
            these terms and conditions will apply, except that failure or defect in any delivery will not entitle the
            Customer to repudiate the Agreement.

            <br><br>
            2.2. OurSupport will schedule delivery for the date notified to the Customer, but delivery may be postponed
            because of conditions beyond OurSupport's reasonable control, and in no event will OurSupport be liable for
            any damages for delay in delivery. Time shall not be of the essence.
            <br><br>
            2.3. If the Customer chooses onsite support, the Customer will ensure that the site at which Services are to
            be delivered ("the Site") is accessible and supervised at all times. If the project is of a larger dimension
            or an initial inspection survey is required, OurSupport staff may inspect the Site at an agreed time during
            a period of 30 days before the scheduled delivery date, with the Customer's permission. OurSupport will not
            be held accountable for any mishaps as a result of the local IT support being left unaccompanied.
            <br><br>
            2.4. The service will be agreed upon between the engineer and the customer. While OurSupport recommends
            normal business hours, after-hours or weekend services may be required by the customers.
            <br><br>
            2.5. If the Customer refuses or fails to take delivery of Services, the Customer will be responsible for
            settling any charges incurred with service delivery. All services are approved in real-time via the
            application.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-respTitle">3. Customer Responsibilities</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-respDescription">
            3.1. The Customer will provide
            Oursupport with all necessary information, facilities, services, and
            accessories reasonably required by Oursupport for the delivery of the
            Services.
            <br><br>
            3.2. The Customer will ensure that their personnel are available
            to assist and cooperate with Oursupport in the installation, testing, and
            acceptance of the Services.
            <br><br>
            3.3. The Customer will be responsible for
            ensuring that the Site is adequately prepared and meets the
            environmental specifications necessary for the safe and efficient operation
            of the Services.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-chargesTitle">4. Charges and Payment</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-chargesDescription">
            4.1. Charges for Services will be as specified
            in the associated Schedule and will be payable by the Customer as per the
            terms set out therein.
            <br><br>
            4.2. All payments will be made in accordance with
            the payment terms specified in the associated Schedule.
            <br><br>
            4.3. The
            Customer will pay all invoices in full without any set-off, deduction, or
            withholding except as required by law.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-paymentsTitle">5. Customer Payments</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-paymentsDescription">
            5.1. Customer payments are calculated on a 30-minute basis. The pricing is reflected as per your country and
            discount if applicable. Any ticket worked will always require that a customer approves and accepts the
            maximum hours that can be invoiced. All hours are billed in 30-minute cycles, up to a maximum of the total
            hours preapproved by the customer. If additional time is required, the engineer working on the ticket will
            request it, and can only proceed to work if the customer agrees beforehand to the additional hours and
            associated cost.
            <br><br>
            5.2. Customers will not be charged at the beginning of the ticket. OurSupport captures the credit card or
            payment details, however, will only be invoiced once the ticket is closed, or after 4 hours is outstanding
            after a 24-hour period.
            <br><br>
            5.3. Customer payments are made using the Stripe
            payment platform (<a href="https://stripe.com">www.stripe.com</a>), following all the regulations required.
            Money is only charged after the customer has agreed or after a 4-hour
            balance is opened after 00:00 each day.
            <br><br>
            5.4. Customer chargeable rates
            and pricing are disclosed in the rates section inside the application and
            customer profile. We have also included a section on the home page of
            the application to promote transparency to all our customers.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-salesTitle">6. Sales Advocate Program</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-salesDescription">
            6.1. The Sales Advocate Program is intended to incentivize selected users to actively promote other users to
            use the OurSupport application and earn an agreed percentage during a predefined time limited on all billed
            activities to users that a "sales advocate" has signed on to the OurSupport platform. Sales advocates can be
            non-employees and will earn a commission based on the chargeable rate to our customers.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-cancellationTitle">7. Rescheduling and Cancellation</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-cancellationDescription">
            7.1. Customers are allowed to
            reschedule at any time, however, will be liable to pay for any time that
            has already been worked on their ticket request.
            <br><br>
            7.2. All Customer
            requests for rescheduling or cancellation will only be valid if made in
            writing to Oursupport.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-substitutionTitle">8. Acceptance of Services</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-substitutionDescription">
            8.1. All our services are done on the basis of
            a ticket request by the customer. Once the ticket is closed and approved
            by the customer, it is assumed that the customer has tested and is
            satisfied with the work done.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-disputeTitle">9. Dispute Resolution</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-disputeDescription">
            9.1. Any dispute arising in connection with this Agreement shall in the first instance be referred to a
            Board
            level director of each party for discussion and potential resolution within 7 days of the date of referral.
            Neither party may initiate any legal action until this action has been carried out unless one party has
            reasonable cause to do so in order to avoid immediate damage to its business or to preserve any right of
            action it might have. This clause will not apply in respect of any application to a court having
            jurisdiction in respect of a preliminary injunction in order to protect its interests.
            <br><br>
            9.2. Subject to clause 9.1., any dispute between the parties about any matter relating to the performance of
            this Agreement (other than in relation to the payment of any money) which cannot be resolved by the parties
            within 20 days of the date of referral referred to above, will first be referred to mediation or other
            alternative dispute resolution procedure as agreed between the parties, each acting in good faith. If the
            parties are unable to agree on a procedure or any aspect of a procedure, they will seek assistance. Unless
            otherwise agreed, the parties will share equally the costs of mediation, and the use of mediation will be
            without prejudice to the rights of the parties in all respects if the mediation does not achieve an agreed
            resolution of the dispute.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-modsTitle">10. Substitution & Modification</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-modsDescription">
            10.1. Oursupport reserves the right to
            supply Services to which improvements, substitutions, modifications, or
            enhancements may have been made.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-indemTitle">11. Indemnities and Limits of Liability</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-indemDescription">
            11.1. The Customer agrees that it has accepted these terms and conditions in the knowledge that OurSupport's
            liability is limited and that the Charges have been calculated accordingly. The Customer is advised to make
            its own insurance arrangements if it desires to limit further its exposure to risk or if it requires further
            or different cover. OurSupport will be willing to provide reasonable assistance to the Customer if the
