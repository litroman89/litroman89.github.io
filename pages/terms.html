            (“Products”) and services (“Services”) are supplied by Oursupport to the customer (“Customer”) at the Site
            for the prices and/or licence fees (“Charges”) as further specified in these terms and conditions and
            associated Schedule.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-acceptanceTitle">1. ORDER ACCEPTANCE</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-acceptanceDescription">
            1.1 Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Oursupport in writing, these terms and conditions will apply to any
            orders or requests from the Customer for Products or Services, and will supersede any other terms and
            conditions referred to, offered, or relied on by the Customer. Specific terms and conditions of oursupport
            relating to Products or Services will prevail over these conditions in the event of any conflict and also,
            in respect of the Software to the conditions of its third party license agreement. Subject to this, no
            variation to these terms will be binding unless agreed to and signed by a director of oursupport
            (Tsolnetworks).
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-deliveryTitle">2. DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND RISK OF LOSS</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-deliveryDescription">
            2.1 Each service delivery under this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a separate agreement to which
            these terms and conditions will apply, except that failure or defect in any delivery will not entitle the
            Customer to repudiate the Agreement.
            <br><br>
            2.2 Oursupport / Tsolnetworks will schedule delivery for the date notified to the Customer, but delivery may
            be postponed because of conditions beyond Oursupport / Tsolnetworks’s reasonable control, and in no event
            will Oursupport / Tsolnetworks be liable for any damages for delay in delivery. Time shall not be of the
            essence.
            <br><br>
            2.3 The Customer will make the site at which Products are to be delivered (“the Site”) available for
            inspection by appropriate Oursupport / Tsolnetworks staff at an agreed time during a period of 30 days
            before the scheduled delivery date, if so required by Oursupport / Tsolnetworks.
            <br><br>
            2.4 Delivery will be made during normal working hours to the Site as agreed with the Customer.
            <br><br>
            2.5 If the Customer refuses or fails to take delivery of Products, delivery shall nevertheless be deemed to
            have taken place for the purposes of Oursupport / Tsolnetworks’s rights to payment, and Oursupport /
            Tsolnetworks will be entitled to store Products at the Customer’s risk and expense, including all
            transportation charges.
            <br><br>
            2.6 Risk will pass to the Customer at the time of delivery. Responsibility for insuring the Products is
            therefore the Customer’s from the time of delivery. Title to Hardware only will pass to the Customer when
            all invoiced Charges due to Oursupport / Tsolnetworks have been paid in full. Software supplied by
            Oursupport / Tsolnetworks is not sold but supplied on the basis of its licensor’s terms and conditions of
            use, with which the Customer must agree and comply.
            <br><br>
            2.7 The Customer must notify Oursupport / Tsolnetworks of any claim for shortages or for damaged Products
            within 7 days of delivery.

            connection.
            <br><br>
            3.2 Where the Hardware includes data communications equipment, and data transmission speeds are given, these
            are at all times subject to any conditions of the applicable telecommunications utility supplier relating to
            the capability of any of that supplier ‘s equipment to which the Hardware is linked.
            <br><br>
            3.3 Acceptance will take place at the Site when Oursupport / Tsolnetworks demonstrates that the test
            procedures, diagnostic and/or verification programs applicable to the Products work properly. If Oursupport
            / Tsolnetworks’s demonstration of the test procedure and/or programs at the Site is delayed for more than 7
            working days other than through any fault of Oursupport / Tsolnetworks, the Products will be deemed to be
            accepted. In the event that any Hardware item should fail acceptance procedures, Oursupport / Tsolnetworks
            will at its option, replace or repair that item.
            <br><br>
            3.4 All proprietary rights in all patents, designs, copyrights engineering details, schematics, drawings and
            other similar data relating to the Hardware are and shall at all times remain vested in the manufacturer of

            Software is installed correctly. Upon completion of these tests, the Software will be deemed to be accepted.
            <br><br>
            4.2 Copyright subsists in all Software including its documentation. No rights in intellectual property in

            Software, including entering into and complying with licence agreements and other agreements with the third
            party prior to the Customer using the Software concerned, and to indemnify Oursupport / Tsolnetworks at the
            suit of a third party Software owner as a result of any breach by the Customer of such conditions.
            <br><br>
            4.4 The Oursupport mobile appliction uses limited GPS tracking technology when starting the "TRAVEL" task
            within the Oursupport mobile application. In order to guarantee and justify the Travel activity, it is
            required that a route map is created during the time that the TRAVEL task is active. This GPS tracking
            access is only used when the Travel task is started and the GPS tracking switched off when the travel
            activity is paused or the ticket is closed (whichever of the two that comes first). The Oursupport mobile
            application users agree and accept to allow and comply with this tracking requirement and undertake to not
            in any way alter or falsely plot the GPS locations by using third party Software or any other way of
            manipulating the route during the TRAVEL task activity.
            <br><br>
            4.5 By using the Oursupport mobile application, you agree with the clause and consent that all travel
            activity and maps can be shared within the context of the Ticket that it

            Tsolnetworks employees and thirdparty resources that will directly or indirectly be working with these
            Tickets. Oursupport / Tsolnetworks is not liable or in anyway responsible for any false GPS Tracking, or the
            miss use of this technology by any of the users.
            <br><br>
            4.6 Oursupport / Tsolnetworks, agrees and garantees that the above mentioned GPS Tracking information will
            be used strictly and only for the purpose of justifying the Travel tasks within the Oursupport mobile
            application and shared with the customer / user reports generated related to the ticket event and the
            qawithin the ticketing web portal.

            temporarily suspend this Agreement.
            <br><br>
            6.6 If Oursupport / Tsolnetworks becomes entitled to terminate this Agreement for any reason, any sums then
            due to Oursupport / Tsolnetworks will immediately become payable in full.

            7.1 If the Customer cancels all or any part of an order, or requests changes to the date of shipment or the
            configuration ordered at least 60 days or more before the scheduled ex-factory shipment date or requested
            delivery date, whichever is the later, the Charges for the Products will be limited to charges for
            re-stocking or otherwise as incurred by Oursupport / Tsolnetworks. If the cancellation, rescheduling or
            change or configuration request is less than 60 days, the Customer agrees to pay a cancellation or
            rescheduling charge of 5% of the Charges. If the cancellation is less than 40 days, the cancellation charge
            will be 10% of the Charges. No order changes or rescheduling may be made less than 7 days from the scheduled
            date of shipment. If orders for Products which have been rescheduled are subsequently cancelled, the
            cancellation charges will be based on the amount of notice provided in the initial rescheduling of the order
            or in the cancellation of the order, whichever is less.
            <br><br>
            7.2 In the event of any configuration changes to Hardware, Oursupport / Tsolnetworks reserves the right to

            / Tsolnetworks of a revised delivery date.
            <br><br>
            7.4 The parties agree that the charge set out in this clause is reasonable and is intended as liquidated
            damages and not as a penalty.
