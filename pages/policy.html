        <h3 data-localization="text-data">III. Data Collections and Uses.</h3>

        <h3 data-localization="text-data_a">A. The Data We Collect.</h3>
        <p data-localization="text-data_a_Description">
            OurSupport gathers the following: <br><br>• User-provided data during interactions with OurSupport, such as
            when creating an account. <br>• Data generated during the utilization of our services, like location, ticket
            activity tasks, app usage, and ticket-related data given by the requestor.<br>The subsequent data is
            gathered by OurSupport or on its behalf:<br><br>1. User-Provided Data. This encompasses: <br><br>• User
            Profile: We gather data when users establish or update their OurSupport accounts. This could include their
            name, email, phone number, country, city, password, and profile picture. We do not request or gather payment
            or banking details (including associated payment verification information), driver’s license, and other
            government identification documents (which may reveal document numbers as well as birth date, gender, and
            photo) within the OurSupport mobile application. <br>• We might use the photos submitted by users to confirm
            their identities, such as through facial recognition technologies. For additional information, please refer
            to the section titled “How we use personal data.” <br>• Background Check and Identity Verification: We
            utilize all accessible social media and online systems to conduct a background check and verify the identity
            of Service Representatives. <br>• User Content: We gather the information users provide when they reach out
            to or use the OurSupport app. This could include feedback, photographs, or other recordings collected by
            users. <br><br> 2. Data Generated During Service Use. This encompasses: <br><br>• Location Data (Service
            Representatives): OurSupport gathers this data when the OurSupport app is operational, and the “TRAVEL” task
            has been initiated by the Service Representative. The app can be running in the foreground (app open and
            on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device.<br>• Transaction Information:
            We gather transaction details related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested
            or provided, order details, delivery information, date and time the service was provided, and distance
            traveled.<br>• Usage Data: We gather data about how users interact with our services. This includes data
            such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of
            browser, and third- party sites or services used before interacting with our services. In some cases, we
            gather this data through cookies, pixels, tags, and similar tracking technologies that create and maintain
            unique identifiers.<br>• Device Data: We may gather data about the devices used to access our services,
            including the hardware models, device IP address, operating systems and versions, software, preferred
            languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers, device motion data, and
            mobile network data. We use the app store’s standard collection platform for this.<br>• Communications Data:
            We enable users to communicate with each other and OurSupport through OurSupport’s mobile apps and website.
            For example, we enable Customers and Service Representatives to update comments, report documents such as
            user intervention reports, goods delivered documents, and activity tasks (without disclosing their telephone
            numbers and personal information to each other). To provide this service, OurSupport stores the
            above-mentioned data regarding all ticket activity, including the date and time of the updates, comments,
            activities. OurSupport may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes
            between users), for safety and security purposes, to improve our products and services, and for analytics.
            <br><br>3. Data from Other Sources. This encompasses: <br>• User feedback, such as ratings, feedback, or
            compliments on our website or on the release mobile app store. <br>• Users or others providing information
            in connection with claims or disputes.<br>• Publicly available sources.<br>• Marketing service
            providers.<br>OurSupport may combine the data collected from these sources with other data in its
            possession.

        <h3 data-localization="text-data_e">E. Data Retention and Deletion.</h3>
        <p data-localization="text-data_e_Description">
            OurSupport retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes
            described above. Users may request deletion of their accounts at any
            time. OurSupport may retain user data after a deletion request due to
            legal or regulatory requirements or for the reasons stated in this policy. OurSupport retains user data for
            as long as necessary for the purposes described above.
            This means that we retain different categories of data for different periods
            of time depending on the category of user to whom the data relates, the
            type of data, and the purposes for which we collected the data.
            <br><br>
            Users may request deletion of their account at any time via email to
            remove@oursupport.co. Following an account deletion request,
            OurSupport deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be
            retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety,
            security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the
            user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or
            dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements
            relating to Service Representatives, this generally means that we retain
            their account and data for a minimum of 5 years after a deletion request
            except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.
        </p>



        <h3 data-localization="text-choice">IV. Choice and Transparency.</h3>
        <p data-localization="text-choiceDescription">
            OurSupport provides users with the ability to manage and control the data collected by OurSupport, this
            includes: <br><br>• Settings within the app.<br>• Permissions on the device.<br>• Pages for ratings within
            the app.<br>• Opting out of marketing.<br><br>Additionally, OurSupport allows users to request access to
            their data or copies of it, make changes or updates to their accounts, delete their accounts, or ask
            OurSupport to limit the processing of their personal data.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-choice_a">A. Privacy Settings.</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-choice_a_Description">
            When the travel task in the OurSupport app is initiated, users are asked to either grant or deny access to
            their location-sharing preferences. <br><br>• Location Data: <br>The OurSupport app utilizes the location
            services of the Service Representatives' devices solely during the Travel activity. This is to generate map
            route details during the travel activity to validate the travel activity, location, time, and distance.
            Through the Settings menu on their mobile device's operating system, Service Representatives can choose to
            allow or deny OurSupport access to their device's location data. Without granting location tracking
            permission to the OurSupport mobile app, users will be unable to log time for the travel activity. All other
            functions will operate normally even if location permission is turned off.
        </p>

        <h3 data-localization="text-choice_b">B. Device Permissions.</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-choice_b_Description">
            Various mobile device platforms such as iOS, Android, etc., have established specific types of device data
            that cannot be accessed by apps without the consent of the device owner. These platforms have diverse
            methods for obtaining that consent. For instance, iOS devices alert users when the OurSupport app requests
            access to certain data types for the first time, providing users with the choice to approve or deny the
            request. On the other hand, Android devices inform users about the permissions required by the OurSupport
            app before they start using the app for the first time, and using the app is considered as granting those
            permissions.

        <h3 data-localization="text-choice_c">C. User Data Requests.</h3>

        <p data-localization="text-choice_c_Description">
