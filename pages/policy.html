            reasons or

            other
            service representative.<br><br>
            3- With the general public<br>
            Questions or comments from users submitted through public forms or social media pages may be viewable by the

            5- For legal reasons or in the event of a dispute<br>
            Oursupport may share users’ personal data if we believe it’s required by applicable law, regulation,
            operating
            license or agreement, legal process or governmental request, or where the disclosure is otherwise
            appropriate
            due to safety or similar concerns.<br>
            This includes sharing personal data with law enforcement officials, public health officials, other
            government
            authorities, airports (if required by the airport authorities as a condition of operating on airport
            property),
            or other third parties as necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, user agreements, or other policies; to
            protect Oursupport’s rights or property or the rights, safety, or property of others; or in the event of a
            claim
            or dispute relating to the use of our services. <br>
            This also includes sharing personal data with others in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
            merger,
            sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our

            6- With consent<br>

        </p>

        <h3>E. Data retention and deletion</h3>
        <p>
            Oursupport retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.<br>
            Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Oursupport may retain user data after a deletion
            request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for the reasons stated in this policy. <br>
            Oursupport retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. This means that we
            retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the category of user to whom
            the
            data relates, the type of data, and the purposes for which we collected the data.<br>
            Users may request deletion of their account at any time via email to remove@oursupport.co <br>
            Following an account deletion request, Oursupport deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be
            retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or
            because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or
            dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to service representative
            persons,
            this generally means that we retain their account and data for a minimum of 5 years after a deletion request
            except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.
        </p>



        <h3>IV. Choice and transparency </h3>
        <p>
            Oursupport enables users to access and control the data that Oursupport collects, including through:<br>
            • In-app settings<br>
            • Device permissions<br>
            • In-app ratings pages<br>
            • Marketing opt-outs<br><br>
            Oursupport also enables users to request access to or copies of their data, changes or updates to their
            accounts, deletion of their accounts, or that Oursupport restrict its processing of user personal data.
        </p>

        <h3>A- Privacy settings</h3>

        <p>
            When the Oursupport app travel task is started, the user is promoted to allow or deny access to their
            location-sharing preferences. <br><br>
            • Location data<br><br>
            Oursupport uses service representatives’ device location services only during the Travel activity within the
            oursupport app. This is used to plot map route information during the travel activity to ensure that the
            travel
            activity, location, time and distance can be justified one. <br>
            Service representatives may enable or disallow Oursupport to use location data from their mobile devices
            through
            the Settings menu on the operating system of their mobile device. Users will not be able to claim time on
            the
            travel activity without granting permission to location tracking to the Oursupport mobile app. All other
            actives
            will work as per normal , with the location permission disabled.
        </p>

        <h3>B- Device permissions</h3>

        <p>
            Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot
            access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that
            permission
            can be obtained. iOS devices notify users the first time the Oursupport app requests permission to access
            certain types of data and gives users the option to grant or refuse permission. Android devices notify users
            of
            the permissions that the Oursupport app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app
            constitutes
            a grant of such permission.
        </p>

        <h3>C- User data requests</h3>

        <p>
            Oursupport provides users with a variety of ways to learn about, control, and submit questions and comments
            about Oursupport’s handling of their data. <br>

            menus
            in the Oursupport app, or through Oursupport’s website.<br>

            personal
            data, or that we limit our use of their data. Oursupport may continue to process data after such objection
            or
