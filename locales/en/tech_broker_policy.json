        "introductionTitle": "1. Introduction",
        "introductionDescription": "We are excited to introduce the OurSupport Tech Broker Program, designed to facilitate partnerships between engineers and Tech Brokers. This program allows engineers to delegate earnings management to a Tech Broker, ensuring structured commission handling and financial convenience. <br><br>The Tech Broker Program functions similarly to the Sales Advocate Program but is specifically tailored for engineers who prefer to work under a broker for financial and administrative ease.",
        "employmentTitle": "2. Non-Employment Relationship",
        "employmentDescription": "• Participation in this program does not create an employer-employee relationship between Tech Brokers and OurSupport or between Tech Brokers and engineers. <br><br>• Tech Brokers are independent participants and not employees, contractors, or representatives of OurSupport, its shareholders, or direct employees.",
        "limitationTitle": "3. Limitation of Liability",
        "limitationDescription": "• OurSupport is not liable for any errors, omissions, or disputes between Tech Brokers and engineers. <br><br> • OurSupport does not assume responsibility for any commitments, expectations, or financial agreements made between brokers and engineers outside the platform.",
        "respTitle": "4. Responsibilities of the Tech Broker",
        "respDescription": "• Tech Brokers manage withdrawals and earnings for engineers assigned to them. <br><br>• Brokers must process withdrawals for engineers who have self-withdrawal disabled. <br><br>• OurSupport does not provide training or direct financial oversight beyond the platform’s built-in automation.",
        "paymentsTitle": "5. Commission & Payment Structure",
        "paymentsDescription": "• Tech Brokers earn commission by inviting and managing other IT technicians within the platform. <br><br>• Fixed Commission Model: Brokers set a fixed hourly/ticket-based commission amount when connecting with an engineer. <br><br>• Once set, the commission rate cannot be modified unless the broker cancels and re-invites the engineer. <br><br>• Payments are automated, with commissions reflected in the wallets of both brokers and engineers.",
        "regionTitle": "6. Region Changes & Connection Termination",
        "regionDescription": "• If an engineer changes regions, their connection to the Tech Broker is automatically terminated. <br><br>• Once terminated, the engineer’s self-withdrawal feature is reactivated, allowing them to manage their own earnings. <br><br>• Both the Tech Broker and Engineer will receive system notifications upon disconnection.",
        "cancellationTitle": "7. Tech Broker Cancellation",
        "cancellationDescription": "• A Tech Broker can cancel their role at any time but must settle all outstanding balances before doing so. <br><br>• If engineers have pending earnings, the broker must distribute funds before cancellation. <br><br>• Once a broker cancels, all assigned engineers regain self-withdrawal access and can manage their own earnings independently.",
        "updatesTitle": "8. Policy Updates & Modifications",
        "updatesDescription": "• OurSupport reserves the right to modify this program with a 30-day notice to participants.<br><br>• Any modifications will not affect existing earnings or agreements already in place for active engineers.",
        "disputeTitle": "9. Governing Law & Disputes",
        "disputeDescription": "• This agreement is governed by European Union laws. <br><br>• Disputes shall be resolved through arbitration in accordance with the rules of [Arbitration Organization].",
        "entireTitle": "10. Entire Agreement",
        "entireDescription": "• This policy represents the entire agreement between participants and supersedes all previous agreements, whether written or verbal. <br><br>• Any modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties. <br><br>• The invalidity of any clause in this agreement does not affect the validity of the remaining clauses.",
        "confidentTitle": "11. Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure",
        "confidentDescription": "• Tech Brokers and Engineers must maintain confidentiality regarding financial agreements and OurSupport’s business processes. <br><br>• Participants must not share proprietary information related to transactions, commissions, or platform functionality. <br><br>• This confidentiality obligation remains in effect for three (3) years after leaving the program."
